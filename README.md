# gpx-visualisation

**Tools/packages:**
- python 3.10
- gpxpy
- pandas
- plotly
- folium

Not so long ago there was a weekend walk in the Domodedovo district of the Moscow region. In this case a gpx file was recorded, which was interesting to work with. I discovered plotly with useful and beautiful interactive graphs. 

In the future, new functions will be added, work with geopandas and much more.
