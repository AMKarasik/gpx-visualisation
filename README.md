Not so long ago there was a weekend walk in the Domodedovo district of the Moscow region. In this case a gpx file was recorded, which was interesting to work with. I discovered plotly with useful and beautiful interactive graphs. 

In the future, new functions will be added, work with geopandas, shapely and much more.
